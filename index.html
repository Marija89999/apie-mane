        <h1>Marija Juozapavičiūtė</h1>
        <p>Age: 25 years</p>
        <p>Education: Vilnius University (2018-2022) - Physiotherapy</p>
        <p>I am a qualified physiotherapist and certified Pilates reformer and mat instructor. After experiencing a spinal injury, i had to step away from sports and could no longer work as a trainer, so i decided to transition into IT. Currently, I am studying web design and deepening my skills in this field.</p>
        <p>I'm also a big fan of active travel - I love exploring the mountains and going on long hiking trails.</p>
        <p>Now, I have a new goal: to start a home interior business. To support this, I plan to create my own website and learn the process firsthand.</p>
